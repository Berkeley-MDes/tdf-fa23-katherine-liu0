# Kat's Weekly Reports
## Week 5[09/28-10/05]
This week I worked with my team members to specify our vision on Project 2. 

Based on our theme of "Exploring Mental Health Needs of Graduate Students," we decided to design an “emotional vending machine,” which is a unique combination of a shredder and a printer. Users will jot down their negative feelings on provided index cards, put them into the shredder, and in return, receive cheerful and uplifting messages printed out to lift their spirits. We will collect the cheering messages from the cohort community to form a database and feed it to the printing system.

Here is the flow chart of the basic mechanism.

We went to the makerspace and talked to the design specialists for advice. Here are some sketches of the whole structure from brainstorming. (Sketch 1 done by Shayne, Sketch 2 done by Cody, Sketch 3 done by Chris)

Me and Emily also started testing the sensors that we may want to use.

## Week 5[09/21-09/28]
This week I explored more of the Photon Kit, and connected it to the developing space.

This is the first class exercise where we set the breadcrumb and wrote the code to flash the LED bulb.
A video of the working kit can be seen https://youtube.com/shorts/-VTYeR_i7Kg?feature=share

This is the second class exercise where we defined variables and added more dynamics to the flashing. 
Here is my code, where it only flashes the LED when the analog value is greater than 1000. I used the monitor console to determine the threshold value.

## Week 4[09/14-09/21]

This week we started to look at physical computing!

I successfully set up my Photon 2, connected it to the campus IoT network, and tested some starter code!

## Week 3 [09/07-09/14]

This week I personalized my phone stand design and went for print!

Here are my final rendered models.

<img width="300" alt="image-of-stands" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-katherine-liu0/assets/139127563/2abf9f27-53f3-475f-8ac7-43ab2ec1de3a">


Since I was using Form3 printers, for which I had to pay for the material, I tried to simplify the shape and minimize the volume. I used the "shell" commands in Rhino to remove the bottom of my initial design to make it hollow inside. I also created a streamlined version that gets rid of the outer sphere and only keeps the key center structure. 

<img width="300" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-katherine-liu0/assets/139127563/a3bcc721-c590-4053-b6a2-f2e968dd72f2">

For the circular phone stand, I used Grey tough 1500 v1 resin, and for the streamlined, I used Clear v4 resin, which was very lightweight and took much less time to print and cure. Thanks to Charon and Reina who assisted me in removing the tough support material! It took a joint efforts of us three.

Here are the final products.

Here is my brief video about the process. https://youtu.be/HrWu8Tms1RY 

## Week 2 [08/31-09/07]

This week I learned more about Rhino and Grasshopper through online tutorials. 

TJ's walkthrough of the simple phone stand design is especially helpful. 

<img width="300" alt="grasshopper2" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-katherine-liu0/assets/139127563/3878733c-e3dd-4129-903e-9d2818bdff7a">


As I become more familiar with Grasshopper, I feel more confident to play with the parameters and start to how I can incorporate my own aesthetic and design into the given sample.

I'm also exploring the use of python and c# in grasshopper to create more intricate geometries. 



## Week 1 [08/24-08/31]

### Reflections

This week I used laser cutting to make a phone stand.

<img width="300" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-katherine-liu0/assets/139127563/143938d9-3b3b-4c09-99e8-834e25a4a160">



#### Rhino and Grasshopper

The computational design is completed via Rhino and Grasshopper. I've never used Rhino or any 3D-modeling design tools before. The interface was a bit intimidating when I first opened it. 

<img width="300" alt="grasshopper2" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-katherine-liu0/assets/139127563/ccbea282-debc-4aa9-b2cf-ce5077de3186">

I got more comfortable with navigating the files after the tutorials in class and online. During my laser-cutting session, I had a clearer vision of Grasshopper files as Cody provided more industrial practices and tips, such as grouping and organizing modules and disabling unnecessary functions.  

<img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-katherine-liu0/assets/139127563/f11ba455-46b6-44f6-a551-ebe56ac2659f">


<img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-katherine-liu0/assets/139127563/94c74757-32a6-4070-a200-bd84290078a4">





Here are some sweet points that I encountered during my exploration.
1. Feedback/Warning on infeasible model

   When I was playing with the parameters, I dragged the bar to extreme low/high points. The main object in the view turned red as a warning     of an infeasible design.

2. Locating arrows when searching in Grasshopper.

   <img width="300" alt="grasshopper1" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-katherine-liu0/assets/139127563/17d337de-02c2-4c92-9fe9-4199d9bfc683">
   
   While I was terrified by how complex the Grasshopper module was, I was glad and surprised that there were those tiny arrows that helped you locate the modules you are looking for in real-time. This feature is by far the most smooth and considerate one I encountered in     Rhino/Grasshopper...






#### Illustrator

<img width="300" alt="illustrator-view" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-katherine-liu0/assets/139127563/1bac1133-5780-432c-a0d5-3fa37c24802e">

Since I had some experience with Adobe Illustrator before, I did some edits that I was unconfident about making in Rhino. I curved the corners and customized a rasterized 'K' at the front of the base.

### Speculations
While Rhino is an extremely powerful tool in professional 3D design, it requires a high learning curve which is not rookie-friendly. I would prefer built-in tutorials (such as those Adobe Suite would provide when you first enter the software) to provide a vision of the affordances of the software. Even if the tutorial can only provide very basic things, it would make the user feel more confident and welcomed. 

As someone not professional in 3D modeling and only considers casual creation and rapid prototyping, I prefer more lightweight and AI-assisted tools. I have tried Spline 3D, and now they also offer the feature of AI prompts, where you can simply type in text commands, and the AI will create and edit the objects for you. See https://spline.design/ai. Of course, Spline 3D could not be compared to Rhino in terms of versatility and professionalism. But it's a cure for amateurs and a great help for quick prototypes.
