# Kat's Weekly Reports

## Week 1 [08/24-08/31]

### Reflections

This week I used laser cutting to make a phone stand.

#### Rhino and Grasshopper

The computational design is completed via Rhino and Grasshopper. I've never used Rhino or any 3D-modeling design tools before. The interface was a bit intimidating when I first opened it.

I got more comfortable with navigating the files after the tutorials in class and online. During my laser-cutting session, I had a clearer vision of Grasshopper files as Cody provided more industrial practices and tips, such as grouping and organizing modules and disabling unnecessary functions.

Here are some sweet points that I encountered during my exploration.
1. Feedback/Warning on infeasible model

   When I was playing with the parameters, I dragged the bar to extreme low/high points. The main object in the view turned red as a warning     of an infeasible design.

2. Locating arrows when searching in Grasshopper.

   While I was terrified by how complex the Grasshopper module was, I was glad and surprised that there were those tiny arrows that helped you locate the modules you are looking for in real-time. This feature is by far the most smooth and considerate one I encountered in     Rhino/Grasshopper...




#### Illustrator

Since I had some experience with Adobe Illustrator before, I did some edits that I was unconfident about making in Rhino. I curved the corners and customized a rasterized 'K' at the front of the base.

### Speculations
While Rhino is an extremely powerful tool in professional 3D design, it requires a high learning curve which is not rookie-friendly. I would prefer built-in tutorials (such as those Adobe Suite would provide when you first enter the software) to provide a vision of the affordances of the software. Even if the tutorial can only provide very basic things, it would make the user feel more confident and welcomed. 

As someone not professional in 3D modeling and only considers casual creation and rapid prototyping, I prefer more lightweight and AI-assisted tools. I have tried Spline 3D, and now they also offer the feature of AI prompts, where you can simply type in text commands, and the AI will create and edit the objects for you. See https://spline.design/ai. Of course, Spline 3D could not be compared to Rhino in terms of versatility and professionalism. But it's a cure for amateurs and a great help for quick prototypes.
